# Maze-Navigation

Created a C++ program to navigate a maze represented by a 6x6 integer array. The program used algorithms to traverse the maze while effectively handling boundaries and obstacles. This involved im- plementing logic to detect possible paths and ensure accurate movement through the maze.
